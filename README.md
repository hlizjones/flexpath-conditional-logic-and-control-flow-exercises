### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Conditional Logic**:
    
    - If-else statements for decision-making.
    - Else-if chains and the use of logical operators (`&&` and `||`).
    - The ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
    - Switch statements for multiple-case conditions and the concept of fallthrough.
2. **Operators**:
    
    - Comparison operators: greater than, less than, equal to, and not equal to.
    - Strict vs. loose equality operators (`===` vs. `==`).
    - Mathematical operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
    - Increment and decrement operators: prefix and postfix usage.
3. **Logical Operators**:
    
    - Logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) for combining conditions.
    - The NOT (`!`) operator for negating Boolean values.
4. **JavaScript Objects**:
    
    - Creating objects with properties and methods.
    - Understanding the differences between primitive values and reference types.
    - Object equality based on memory reference.
5. **Falsy and Truthy Values**:
    
    - Understanding which values evaluate to false in a Boolean context.
    - The importance of falsy values in conditional checks.
6. **Memory Management**:
    
    - How JavaScript handles memory for primitive values and objects.
    - The concepts of the stack and the heap.
